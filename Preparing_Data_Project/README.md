# Preparing Data for Analysis: Access to Safe and Affordable Drinking Water  
*ALX Data Analytics – Data Preparation Module Project*  
*By Boniface Kibet*

---

## 🌍 Project Overview  
This project focused on developing essential **data and spreadsheet skills**, enabling me to effectively work with data to draw meaningful insights and make informed decisions. By exploring real-world datasets in **Google Sheets**, I learned how to retrieve, manipulate, analyze, and visualize data.  

The concepts were contextualized using **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, allowing me to understand practical applications of spreadsheets in solving real-world problems.

## 🎯 Objectives – Part One: Understanding the Data  
- Investigate access to **safe and affordable drinking water**.  
- Demonstrate spreadsheet proficiency in **importing, analyzing, and visualizing data**.  
- Develop a foundation for **data-driven analysis and decision-making**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques  
- **Google Sheets** – for data cleaning, formulas, functions, and charts.  
- **Spreadsheet Functions** – including SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, IF, and LOOKUP.  
- **Charts and Visualization** – for summarizing data visually.

## 🔍 What I Learned – Part One

Through this first part of the integrated project, I developed strong foundational skills in working with spreadsheets and data:  

- Demonstrated an understanding of **importing data** into Google Sheets.  
- Used **formulas and functions** to manipulate and analyze datasets.  
- Created **charts** to visually communicate insights.  
- Interpreted data through **summary statistics**, including measures of **central tendency** (mean, median, mode) and **spread** (range, variance, standard deviation).  
- Applied skills to **real-world examples** related to the SDGs.

## 🧠 Reflections & Learnings  
This first part of the integrated project reinforced the importance of:  
- **Spreadsheet proficiency** – being able to clean, manipulate, and visualize data efficiently.  
- **Contextual understanding** – linking data analysis to meaningful real-world problems.  
- **Foundational skills** – preparing data correctly sets the stage for deeper analysis in subsequent modules.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps – Part Two: Transforming the Data  
In the next part of the integrated project, I will extend this investigation to **transform and clean the data**, using formulas, functions, and charts in Google Sheets to prepare the dataset for deeper analysis and visualization.  

- Demonstrated the ability to **use spreadsheet functions to transform and clean data**.  
- Demonstrated the ability to **interpret data, summary statistics, and visualizations**.
