# Data Analytics Portfolio – ALX

This repository showcases the projects I completed during the ALX Data Analytics program. It documents my learning journey from preparing and exploring data to querying, analyzing, and visualizing it. Each project reflects hands-on work with real-world datasets and tools used across the data analytics lifecycle.

## Preparing Data Module

During this module, I developed core data and spreadsheet skills essential for working with data effectively. Using Google Sheets, I learned how to retrieve, clean, manipulate, analyze, and visualize data in ways that support clear and informed decision-making.

The exercises were based on real-world datasets, including themes related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This context demonstrated how spreadsheet techniques can be applied to analyze global development issues.

Through practical exercises, case studies, and a project, I built a strong foundation for data-driven analysis and decision-making.

## Integrated Project (Part 1): Understanding the Data – Access to Safe Drinking Water

This project marks the first stage of the ALX Integrated Project. Here, I explored inequalities in access to safe and affordable drinking water across different countries and regions.

Working with SDG-related data, I examined variations in service levels and trends across regions. My work included:

- Importing and preparing datasets in Google Sheets.
- Cleaning and standardizing data for analysis.
- Applying formulas and functions to extract insights.
- Using pivot tables to summarize information.
- Creating visualizations to reveal patterns and regional differences.
- Calculating key summary statistics, including measures of central tendency and spread.
- Interpreting findings to understand disparities in water access.

This stage strengthened my ability to read, interpret, and communicate data insights clearly.
